My personal i3, polybar and rofi dotfiles and with shell scripts for dunst notifications

You're going to need to install nerfonts.
If you ever feel like you can't find the fonts you are looking just head over to https://glyphsearch.com/?copy=unicode (Not my site. It's where I got some of the fonts for my rice. The option in the "copy" section selected needs to be "unicode" in order for you to copy the icon/font/glyph exactly the way it is to the terminal)<br><br>

You're going to need to install nerfonts.
If you ever feel like you can't find the fonts you are looking just head over to https://glyphsearch.com/?copy=unicode (Not my site. It's where I got some of the fonts for my rice. The option in the "copy" section selected needs to be "unicode" in order for you to copy the icon/font/glyph exactly the way it is to the terminal)<br>

<h2>idotfiles setup</h2><br>
chmod a+x wm_setup.sh<br>
./wm_setup.sh<br>
